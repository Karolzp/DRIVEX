# DRIVEX

## About App:
DRIVEX is an application that simulates traffic without interaction with user. There is one road with traffic lights and many randomly generated cars with different speeds. Like in real-world cars are stopping before traffic lights. There is also an airport with an airplane taking off (the last screenshot).
